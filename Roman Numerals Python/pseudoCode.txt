int 2 roman numeral pseudo code

find biggest 'anchor' or 'base' of the number, i.e. if the number is 167 then the process starts with finding the 100 which is the base C

then you need to find the rest of the 67, so find teh biggest base 50

and then the rest for the 17

biggest base of 10

then 5

then 1

and then 1

so ultimately you have C L X V I I 




let's try 99

biggest base is 90, XC

find 9, biggest base IS IX

now you have XCIX


how about 44

XL

IV

XLIV


int2roman(num):
	
	check exit condition if num is in stock chars

	...find the biggest base...

	return str(base) + int2roman(num - base)


fuck recursion

int2roman(num):
	while num > 0:
		string += biggestBaseString(num)
		num -= biggestBaseNumeric(num)
